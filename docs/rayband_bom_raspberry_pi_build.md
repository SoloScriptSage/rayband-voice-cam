## Important Notes

### Camera Cable
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Pi Zero requires a **15-pin camera cable** (thinner), NOT the standard 22-pin cable used by regular Raspberry Pi boards.

### GPIO Header
Most Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W boards come **without GPIO pins pre-soldered**. You'll need to either:
- Solder the 2x20 header yourself (requires soldering iron)
- Buy a pre-soldered version (+$5)
- Use breadboard temporarily for prototyping

### Alternative Camera
Consider upgrading to **Camera Module 3 Wide** (+$10) for 120° field of view, which is better suited for glasses perspective.

### Power Requirements
- Pi Zero 2 W: ~400-600mA under load
- Camera Module: ~200-250mA
- I2S Microphone: ~5mA
- **Total: ~650-900mA** (10000mAh power bank = 11-15 hours runtime)

## Recommended Upgrades

If you have additional budget, consider these improvements:

| Upgrade | Additional Cost | Benefit |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Camera Module 3 **Wide** | +$10 | 120° FOV vs 75° |
| 20000mAh Power Bank | +$15 | Double battery life |
| Bone Conduction Headset | +$80-130 | Professional audio solution |
| Custom 3D Printed Mounts | +$25-50 | Cleaner, more durable mounting |
